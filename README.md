## TL;DR

Contribution Paths are a talent structuring framework that facilitates the growth of a sustainable contributor network, around a specific skill-set or problem-set.

There must be incentives and rewards, and ideally in a self-sustaining way (sustainable value or impact generation). Upfront transparency around dependability and thresholds for qualifying for rewards help set contributor expectations.

Contributors must be given the respect and treated as co-workers. The interactions between the `core team`/`founding members`/`organization` creating the contribution path.

Contribution Paths need to be established collaboratively with contributors. They are a community as much as they are individual contributors. Communities cannot be built, only grown between members. There needs to be thoughtful activity towards building community and networks.

Contribution Paths have two main roles: `contributors` and `maintainers`.

The `contributors` are split into four roles. The first two are for filtering for committed and talented contributors, and the latter two roles to distinguish between average-to-good contributors and the 1% contributors.

Commitment & quality checks

1. `wannabe-contributor` →
2. `contributor-in-training` →

Contribution powerhouse

3. `contributor` →
4. `super-contributor`

The `maintainers` are contributors from any level of the `contributor` role who run and maintain the ecosystem of the Contribution Path. The responsibilities of this role are designed in such a way that correct execution of all actions (but especially controversial maintenance actions such as contributor removals or reward distributions) are publicly verifiable.

- `maintainer`

Let's look at an example Contribution Path to tie all these concepts together:

>

<!-- Path creators will need to be consistently engaged and setting the cultural example. Involved parties from the organization creating the path need to treat contributors seriously, this is an essential cultural cornerstone. Treat contributors as respected co-workers: listen to feedback, respond and evolve with critique and explain decisions or reasoning. Ideally there are also members from the forming organization participating in the path to set quality expectations through example. -->

## What is a Contribution Path?

Contribution Paths are a way to get work done by a distributed network of contributors with some level of surety on the quality of contributions. Contribution Paths focus on one kind of contribution, for example, user support or marketing.

The Contribution Path framework works on three levels:

- **_Bottom up:_** allows contributions to gain context autonomously.
- **_Top down:_** sorts contributors into groups based on their ability/skill set within the selected contribution type.
- **_Sustainability:_** Once a path has been fully implemented, the vast majority of maintenance is run by the path members itself, making it ideal for DAOs and other distributed contribution organizations.

### Key traits of a Contribution Path

- Clearly defined roles and requirements for role progression.
- Permissionless access to required context (ideally all the context needed for the whole path). Effectively having really good documentation around the contribution.
- Explicit tasks & opportunities for contributions for each role.
- Clearly defined expectations for engagement, activity minimums and contribution quality.
- Realistic but firm consequences for violating expectations (i.e if you are inactive for 2 weeks you will move down a role, if you send a scam link you get banned, etc).
- Fair rewards for contributors in various roles, ideally with additional incentives for contributors who go above and beyond.
- Strong community element around contributions (mentorship, collaboration, events & communication surface area).

### Benefits of a Contribution Path

#### For you

- **_Reliable contributors:_** Paths create skill or talent based groups of contributors that one can reasonably rely on for consistent output.
- **_Independent:_** Established paths maintain their own admin, run their own progression programs and facilitate their own coordination. In theory, they could manage their own rewards, however the incentives for quality would need to remain external.

#### For contributors

Contribution Paths have the following benefits for contributors:

- **_Accessibility:_** Enabling community members to onboard themselves through structured and intentional documentation can actually reduce support loads as individuals outside of the path can help themselves.
- **_Flexibility:_** The Contribution Path framework is flexible enough to cover a wide variety of contribution types, making it easier to decentralize more responsibility into your community.
- **_Clear expectations:_** Clearly defined roles and expectations reduce a lot of the human friction and politics that can arise when contributing in a decentralized system.
- **_Churn resilience:_** Through the use of the `maintainer` role, Contribution Paths are relatively resilient to contributor churn, making them more sustainable over longer time horizons.

## Contribution Path roles overview

Contribution Paths are made up of four successive roles and a fifth maintenance role.

`wannabe-contributor` → `contributor-in-training` → `contributor` → `super-contributor`

These successive roles allow for reliable skill bands to form within the contributor community. These different roles contribute towards progressively higher context tasks, and once a path is consistency execute, quality can be tuned to enable reliable executions of more impactful tasks.

`maintainer`

Maintainers give the path structure and consistency. Maintainers track contributions, facilitate memberships for new `in-training` contributors, facilitate path calls and events, and demote contributors who fall below activity or quality minimums. Maintainers can be any member of a path. All their actions and data collection is public and verified by other contributors through incentivize tasks.

In combination these successive and maintenance roles enables the paths to be reliable execution systems, that can handle execution.

### `wannabe-contributor` role overview

- **_Context exposure:_** What path specific context is there that this contribution may require? For example, user supporters would need to understand how a product worked.
- **_Expectation setting:_** What does it mean to be a part of this path, what is expected from me in the various roles?
- **_Contributor culture exposure:_** How do I get involved in contributing? What does a good vs bad contribution look like?
- **_Bot, spammer & promoter filtering:_** The sooner this is done the better, but in this stage it is constant monitoring.
- **_Commitment assessment:_** A set amount of time a contributor must stay at this level regardless of skill or talent. Usually 3 months. This ensures that contributors are "in it for the long haul" and are able to consistently engage.
- **_Contribution quality assessment:_** This role has a limited number of low context tasks that contributors are able to participate in or complete, allowing them to showcase their ability.

### `contributor-in-training` role overview

- **_Mentorship for skills & quality:_** How do things get done, and what is the expectation for contributions? Each `in-training` contributor is assigned a mentor from the existing `contributor` role. This mentor will guide them through the contribution process, and guide them through contributing work that meets (and hopefully exceeds) quality minimums.
- **_Mentorship for culture:_** Who can I ask about x? Culture mentors facilitate introductions into the contributor community. Like skill mentors, are assigned to mew `in-training` contributors by the `maintainer`s. Having both creates some accountability, and gives the new contributor more high contact touch points with the contributor community.
- **_Commitment assessment:_** A set amount of time a contributor must stay at this level regardless of skill or talent. Usually 2 months. This ensures that contributors are "in it for the long haul" and are able to consistently engage.
- **_Contribution quality assessment:_** This role has a limited number of higher context and skill requiring tasks that contributors are able to participate in or complete, allowing them to showcase their ability.

### `contributor` role overview

- **_Execution engine:_** `contributor`s are the powerhouse of Contribution Paths, and are were most of the high quality contributions will be done.
- **_Mentorship & up-skilling:_**
- **_:_**
- **_:_**

### `super-contributor` role overview

- **_High performers:_** This role contains only the highest performing contributors. They should have a high contextual understanding and well as incredible talent or skill in the given contribution type. They can be reliably trusted to contribute impactful, high quality work, or create out the box and creating solutions.
- **_:_**
- **_:_**

### `maintainer` role overview

By having the leadership role & responsibilities of the path divided amongst a role, many of the pitfalls of decentralized collaboration can be avoided.

- **_Diffused leadership:_** As there are multiple contributors with the `maintainer` role, contributors can take breaks and work at a sustainable pace, while holding each other accountable.
- **_Limited politics:_** The execution of the more contentious leadership responsibilities (such as demotions and removals) are codified in the paths governing documents, ensuring little room for power games.
- **_Publicly verifiable:_** All metrics around contributions needs to be publicly verifiable in order for other contributors to be able to verify the correct functioning of the `maintainer`s. Being checked by their fellow contributors also prevents abuse of power.

## Structured design

Contribution Paths require an intentional environment and have incentive requirements. There are many variations you could probably create and still accomplish these requirements, so I will explain the concept with an example implementation.

### Community

One of the key benefits for both contributors and the system as a whole is a collaborative environment, resulting in overall higher quality contributions. To foster collaboration there needs to be a community to collaborate within.

Community events need to be reliably held at a set cadence. They should accommodate chat interactions as well as voice/video interactions. They should be moderated (kicking trolls, its on the internet after all) as well as reliably having contributors with higher context to answer questions & set the cultural vibe.

For example, a twice a week call with at least one path `maintainer` and two `contributors`. The `maintainer` reads the questions from chat as well as facilitating live asks. The two calls are scheduled to cover the average two major timezones of path participants. All `in-training` path participants are highly encouraged to attend live or submit questions in advance and watch the recording. The call is open to anyone in the path.

### Available tasks & contributions

Each successive role will need defined scopes for their contributions. This is a critical step to avoid over eager but low context contributors from causing more harm than good.

`wannabe` contributors need some clearly defined tasks so they can get started, but should also have some scope for more creative or open ended but low context tasks or ideas so talented contributors can show their ability.

`in-training` contributors need opportunities to try out the real thing - smaller versions of `contributor` opportunities are a good way to ensure they will be able to handle the `contributor` role.

The `contributor` role is where the bulk of contributions and responsibilities should be.

## Creating a Contribution Path Checklist

Contributors need to be able to onboard themselves - as such the information required to get started needs to be accessible. If you are targeting multiple languages in your community its highly recommended to get these documents translated. Docs should be written with as little jargon as possible. Avoid "rabbit-linking" - having dozens of out links on a page making it daunting to follow along without reading dozens of pages. If you introduce a concept give a brief explanation rather than out linking - only link to external pages if they are critical to understanding or function.

The following list is intended to set up your path covering the most critical information and common questions. These do not need to be separate documents (they can all be sections in one doc).

- [ ] **_Overview/TL;DR_**: What contribution is this path covering? Why is this work important? What is the scope and goal? The more transparent you can be here the more alignment your path will have.
- [ ] **_Contributions by role_**: What contributions are available to each role in the path? Giving context as to why certain tasks are only available to full contributors will help prevent low context contributors from wasting their time on tasks out of their range.
- [ ] **_Activity minimums_**: Having clear and objective measurements for activity minimums is a half of the _keystones_ of the Contribution Path framework. Activity minimums look like: minimum number of messages, number of tickets solved, rating from tickets solved, number of competed tasks, community calls joined, etc. These metrics need to be objective and publicly verifiable. Any quality minimums need to also meet this publicly verifiable criteria, for example: ratings from end users, views or engagement on content, etc. While some of these metrics will not be sybil resistant, you should try balance this with diversity of metric rather than avoiding game-able metrics.
- [ ] **_Rewards_**: A clear reward & incentive structure. Contributors should be able to gauge how they will be rewarded depending on their engagement. Reward systems do not have to be simple, but they need to be understandable and transparent. Expectations should be clear: is there a guaranteed reward for a certain amount or contributions? Does a specific role come with guarantees? etc. I've found point systems can work quite well, each task is `x points`, every `y period` `z tokens` will be distributed between all points collected in `y period`. Rather under-promise and over deliver here, under-delivering will destroy trust with contributors in a way that is quite difficult to recover from.
- [ ] **_Code of Conduct_**: Paths need to have code of conducts for those who don't know how to treat others with kindness. This can be an extension of existing code of conducts, but should additionally cover mentorship behavior expectations, reporting of violations and the accountability for violation. This should really only be covering "being a dick": bulling, harassment, discrimination, DOXXing, etc.
- [ ] **_Accountability_**: If a contributor fails to meet their roles activity minimum, what happens? Are they demoted or removed? How long do they need to miss the minimum? How can they signal leave/holidays vs going MIA? Combined with the Activity minimums we have the _keystone_ for Contribution Paths. These standards create transparent standards that contributors can agree to.

<!-- # Role deep dives -->

<!-- ## `wannabe-contributor` role

This is where all contributors start their journey. This role should be open to anyone. This role acts as a signal of interest: "hey I'd like to do this contribution!".

There are three main goals for contributors in this role:

1. Gaining context.
1. Showing their skill level through contributions.
1. Engaging & integrating into the contributor community.

### Available tasks & contributions

Contributions for this role should be well defined, low context and low risk for the collective. For example, in user support a low context, low risk task may look like "finding dead links in the documentation" or "assisting other contributors in a user ticket".

It is important that there are sufficient tasks available to keep new contributors engaged. I've found ongoing tasks (monitoring, validating/checking, etc) are better than one and done tasks. Additionally it is critical that no important or irreversible tasks are made available to these "untested" contributors.

<!-- ## Why?

Managing a large, distributed network of contributors is incredibly challenging, even more so when you need their contributions to be of consistent and reliable quality.

I've been developing the Contribution Path framework for just over two years now, and have successfully implemented and iterated on it within the Optimism Collective. As such, its high time the framework gets open sourced! -->
