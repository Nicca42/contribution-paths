# Contribution Paths

A quick and dirty guide to Contribution Paths.

## Why?

Managing a large, distributed network of contributors is incredibly challenging, even more so when you need their contributions to be of a decent and consistent quality.

I've been developing the Contribution Path framework for just over two years now, and have successfully implemented and iterated on it within the Optimism Collective. As such, its high time the framework gets open sourced! Please note that these docs are a draft/WIP.

# What is a Contribution Path?

Contribution Paths are a way to get work done by a distributed network of contributors with some level of surety on the quality of contributions. Contribution Paths focus on one kind of contribution, for example, user support or marketing.

The Contribution Path framework works on three levels:

* ***Bottom up:*** allows contributions to gain context autonomously.
* ***Top down:*** sorts contributors into groups based on their ability/skill set within the selected contribution type.
* ***Sustainability:*** Once a path has been fully implemented, the vast majority of maintenance is run by the path members itself, making it ideal for DAOs and other distributed contribution organizations.

## Key traits of a Contribution Path

* Clearly defined roles and requirements for role progression.
* Permissionless access to required context (ideally all the context needed for the whole path). Effectively having really good documentation around the contribution.
* Explicit tasks & opportunities for contributions for each role.
* Clearly defined expectations for engagement, activity minimums and contribution quality.
* Realistic but firm consequences for violating expectations (i.e if you are inactive for 2 weeks you will move down a role, if you send a scam link you get banned, etc).
* Fair rewards for contributors in various roles, ideally with additional incentives for contributors who go above and beyond.
* Strong community element around contributions (mentorship, collaboration, events & communication surface area).

## Benefits of a Contribution Path

Contribution Paths have the following benefits:

* ***Scale:*** As established paths (almost) run themselves, they are easy to scale up.
* ***Accessibility:*** Enabling community members to onboard themselves through structured and intentional documentation can actually reduce support loads as individuals outside of the path can help themselves.
* ***Flexibility:*** The Contribution Path framework is flexible enough to cover a wide variety of contribution types, making it easier to decentralize more responsibility into your community.
* ***Clear expectations:*** Clearly defined roles and expectations reduce a lot of the human friction and politics that can arise when contributing in a decentralized system.
* ***Churn resilience:*** Through the use of the `maintainer` role, Contribution Paths are relatively resilient to contributor churn, making them more sustainable over longer time horizons.

# How does a Contribution Path work?

Contribution Paths are made up of four successive roles and a fifth maintenance role.

1. `wannabe-contributor`
1. `contributor-in-training`
1. `contributor`
1. `super-contributor`

* `maintainer`

Each of these roles play a critical part in social signaling, onboarding, expectation setting and incentive design. Lets break them down!

## Wannabe-contributors role

This is where all contributors start their journey. This role should be open to anyone. This role acts as a signal of interest: "hey I'd like to do this contribution!".

There are three main goals for contributors in this role:

1. Gaining context.
1. Showing their skill level through contributions.
1. Engaging & integrating into the contributor community.

### Available tasks & contributions

Contributions for this role should be well defined, low context and low risk for the collective. For example, in user support a low context, low risk task may look like "finding dead links in the documentation" or "assisting other contributors in a user ticket".

It is important that there are sufficient tasks available to keep new contributors engaged. I've found ongoing tasks (monitoring, validating/checking, etc) are better than one and done tasks. Additionally it is critical that no important or irreversible tasks are made available to these "untested" contributors.
